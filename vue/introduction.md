Vue is a progressive web framework for building user interfaces. Like React, it's a View only and further libraries can be added to it to extend its functionalities.

Vue uses a declarative rendering format.

It takes a lot of inspiration from Angular and React, but a lot of its state management and observer patterns are based on Angular
